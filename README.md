Loops
While loop Code: While(){
}
Takes a Boolean condition; Keeps looping until condition is false; Repeating if statement.
For Loop Code: for(){
}
Doesnâ€™t take a Boolean condition; Takes 3 parameters (initialize the variable; set a condition to run; increment/ decrement the values given (a++, a--etc.)
Do While loop Code: do{
} While(){
} 
Makes sure the code inside runs regardless if the condtion is met. The code is run and then the condition is checked. If the condtion is not met the code wont loop again.
	
Arrays Code: [ ] 
A Variable that holds  more than one value.
1.	Initialize the array. 
2.	Enter values manually or use value given. 
How to use in a loop? 
 We can use built in variables/properties that arrays have to loop.
OOP: Object Oriented Property
Making classes with attributes(variables) and methods that you can use to loop.

Polymorphism
Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters .This is called overloading .
Overrinding Extending to another class
 allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
Inheritance

Inherits methods/ variables from others. You can have however any attributes/methods you like.
Good for reusability of code
You can have multiple classes extended them to others.




Encapsulation
Any object in the real world can be in an OOP.
Usually private or ignored
Access modifiers change when you make an object; they show you 
 which variables/methods you have access to.
-The switch statement solves a problem in the same way that the if-else-if does. So, it's ideal for cases when you have more than two paths. The difference between the if-else-if and the switch statements is that the if-else-if checks the condition to be true; whereas the switch statement checks for equality.

-Sometimes your repetitive tasks also contain repetitive sub-tasks. In the case, you need a loop inside of a loop.
These are also known as nested loops.
